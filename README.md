# passwordGenerator

<p>With HTML, CSS, and JS (up to you to learn jQuery)

Create an application that creates a randomly generated password

It must
- Only take passwords that are longer than 6 characters but shorter than 50 characters total
- Ask the user what kinds of characters they want (lower/upper case characters, numbers, symbols)
- Must take at least one character
- Display error messages to the user if they either input a bad length or do not choose at least one character type
- Your code must be DRY (worry about this at the end!)


## Resources
### JQuery!

## Example Mock up
Please feel free to take creative liberty with this/simplify it/change the style. I don't care what it looks like as long as the looks of the site don't interfere with the functionality of the site overall. Make it easy and intuitive for the user as much as possible! The screenshot below is from [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator) feel free to play with their website before getting started!

*Feel free to google PW generators that already exist, there are plenty. I know them all though and will recognize them if I see it, so please write as much original code as possible! When taking from online resources I expect you to add explanatory comments to show understanding - otherwise change up the code to fit the site!*</p>
