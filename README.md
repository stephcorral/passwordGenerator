# Password Generator
<p>
With HTML, CSS, and JS
</p>

<p>
Create an application that creates a randomly generated password
</p>

<h4>It must</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only take passwords that are longer than 6 characters but shorter than 50 characters total</li>
<li>Ask the user what kinds of characters they want (lower/upper case characters, numbers, symbols)</li>
<li>Must take at least one character</li>
<li>Display error messages to the user if they either input a bad length or do not choose at least one character type</li>
<li>Your code must be DRY (worry about this at the end!)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Done!</h1>
